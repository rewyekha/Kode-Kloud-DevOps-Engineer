# Day 68: Set Up Jenkins Server

The DevOps team at xFusionCorp Industries is initiating the setup of CI/CD pipelines and has decided to utilize Jenkins as their server. Execute the task according to the provided requirements:

1\. Install `Jenkins` on the jenkins server using the `apt` utility only, and start it using the `service` command.

* If you face a timeout issue while starting the Jenkins service, first check the service status with `service jenkins status`
* Then review the logs in `/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log` to identify the cause.

2\. Jenkin's admin user name should be `theadmin`, password should be `Adm!n321`, full name should be `Siva` and email should be `siva@jenkins.stratos.xfusioncorp.com`.

`Note:`

1\. To access the `jenkins` server, connect from the jump host using the `root` user with the password `S3curePass`.

2\. After Jenkins server installation, click the `Jenkins` button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI and follow on-screen instructions to create an admin user.
